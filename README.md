Task Management System

This Task Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline task organization and enhance productivity. It provides a clear distinction between administrative and user functionalities:

Admin Features: 
Admins have complete visibility over all tasks in the system. They can monitor task progress, view task details for all users, and ensure accountability and timely completion.

User Features: 
Users can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own tasks. They can add new tasks, update task details, track progress, and remove completed or unnecessary tasks, giving them full control over their personal workflow.

The system is intuitive and user-friendly made with MERN, making task management simple, organized, and efficient for both administrators and users.
